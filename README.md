what began as curious investigations to add capabilities to an online resume exploded into a two year obsession with learning front-end development. Today the site is the base of my first foray into front-end design and development.

## Built on the understrap-child theme

Developed by @holger1411 and various contributors. It can be found at <https://github.com/understrap/understrap-child>

## Development is a mashup of

### Wordpress

I utilized Wordpress to support future plans to add a blog.  Otherwise minimal wordpress conventions (plug-ins, widgets, etc.) were limited tools to aid SEO and migration.  I wanted to keep the site as light as possible. Basic PHP was incorporated to enable a page+panels-based structure that quickened development & content revisions.

### understrap-child

Understrap child is a skeleton theme for Understrap; a WP-based framework built on bootstrap 4 and the Underscores theme by Automatic. The theme provided a blank canvas and a hefty gulp-driven set of pre/post processors to aid development and site performance (i.e. sass, browsersync and an array of linting, minification and optimization modules).

### boostrap 4 / flexbox / sass

I began this site with a basic understanding of html and css. My skills in bootstrap, flexbox and sass developed organically as I sought various solutions and capabilities. Eventually I developed a thorough understanding of bootstrap's strengths and weaknesses and where and how to rely on flexbox. Also, I grasped the benefits of moderate/advanced sass to eliminate duplication and bloat.

### refactoring

Upon investigation you'll see a vareity of conventions and practices (BEM, Atomic, etc.). The inconsistent and varying accuracy in the implementation of these principles reflects my continued learnings and evolution as a developer as I built the site. I plan to continue refactoring as a means of honing my understanding of Atomic Design and Pattern Lab principles to produce modular design systems.
