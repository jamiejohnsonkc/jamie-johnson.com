Bootstrap 4 Navbar Collapse Examples

How to change the Navbar collapse in Bootstrap 4
New: This article was updated in 2018 for Bootstrap 4.1

The new Bootstrap 4 Navbar Component is a big improvement over it’s 3.x predecessor.

The 3.x Navbar collapsed into its vertical mobile layout when the viewport width (breakpoint) was 768 pixels or less. It was possible to change this Navbar breakpoint via the `grid-float-breakpoint` LESS variable, or using this custom CSS override hack. Not ideal for quick responsive design.

Hello Bootstrap 4
In Bootstrap 4, the Navbar is responsive by default and utilizes flexbox to make alignment of Navbar content much easier. It’s also a simple matter of using the new navbar-expand-* classes to change the Bootstrap 4 Navbar breakpoint. Now the Navbar has 6 breakpoint sizes or “states” so that you can easily have one of the following Navbar options..

— The Navbar never collapses into the vertical mobile view, and is always horizontal.

— The Navbar is always collapsed into the vertical view, and toggled via the hamburger.

— The Navbar expands into horizontal mode at one of the 4 responsive breakpoints.

The Default Bootstrap 4 Navbar
<nav class="navbar navbar-light navbar-expand-md">
  <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Navbar</a>
  <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbar1">
    <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
  </button>
  <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbar1">
    <ul class="navbar-nav mr-auto">
      <li class="nav-item active">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Home</a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Link</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</nav>
As you can see from the code above, the navbar-expand-md class in the nav would make this Navbar collapse vertically (and show the toggler icon) at the medium (md) breakpoint of 992px.

To change to a different breakpoint, we’d just need to swap out navbar-expand-md with one of these..

navbar-expand = never collapses vertically (remains horizontal)
navbar-expand-sm = collapses below sm widths <576px
navbar-expand-md = collapses below md widths <768px
navbar-expand-lg = collapses below lg widths <992px
navbar-expand-xl = collapses below xl widths <1200px
