If you wish to put breakpoints into your settings for use with responsive typography then there are helpers in place for this. Simply organize your config with breakpoint values from smallest to largest:

$modularscale: (
  base: 12px,
  ratio: 1.5,
  400px: (
    ratio: 1.2,
  ),
  900px: (
    base: 16px,
    ratio: 1.3,
  ),
  1200px: (
    base: 16px,
    ratio: 1.6,
  ),
);

Note that you must use the same units for both your type and your breakpoints for this to work

This technique is based on Mike Riethmuller’s Precise control over responsive typography. A fantastic technique for fluidly scaling typography.

Then, call the mixin @include ms-respond(); and a fully fluid and responsive scale will be generated.

h2 {
  @include ms-respond(font-size,5);
}

If you do happen to have any values that are just named without numbers they will be ignored by the responsive mixin, it’s smart enough to just pull values that look like breakpoints.
