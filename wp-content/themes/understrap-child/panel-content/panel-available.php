<h5>Thanks Recession</h5>
Two years ago I took a break from my career. Like many marketers the recession wasn't kind to me.</div>
<div class="copy">
<h5>Limited Options</h5>
And due to a family illness, a new house and the arrival of a second child relocation wasn't an option.</div>
<div class="copy">
<h5>Oil & Water</h5>
I accepted roles I knew weren't right for me. Unsurprisingly, things did not go so well. So I took some time off to focus on me and raise my kids.</div>
<div class="copy">
<h5>Back on the horse</h5>
Today I'm looking to regain the forward momentum I enjoyed before the recession. Eventually I'd like to join an organization with similar perspectives about strategic marketing.</div>
<div class="copy">
<h5>Available for Project Work</h5>
Until then I'm available for freelance or contract opportunities&mdash; especially in any web design or development capacity.</div>
