			<div class="subhead"><h3>Why This. Why Now.</h3></div>
			<div class="tldr"><h4><strong>TL;DR:</strong>I was an over-achiever on the fast track before the recession and some major family obligations put my career on hold. While away I became a front-end designer/developer. Now I want to put my new (and old) skills to use however I can.</h4></div>

<!-- 			<div class="display-text">After 20 years in corporate and agency environments I'm just as comfortable leading C-Level initiatives as I am coding websites.</div> -->
			<div class="display-text">I started in agency account management because I couldn't decide which discipline appealed to me the most. Over a decade of leading client initiatives I developed an expertise in strategic planning and project management while sponging up a blah from some of the best minds in creative, media, research, PR and digital.   
			<div class="display-text">As my career progressed I discovered I had a latent penchant for marketing strategy and management. Many of my agency clients were transplants from sales and new to marketing. So they often sought counsel on challenges they faced beyond promotions. Over time I evolved from "agency guy" to de facto marketing manager.</div>
			<div class="display-text">Later on I found my way into corporate marketing management where my electic skill set served me well. With a skill set ranging from beginning to end of the marketing process, I excelled at advising senior leaders and executives on all things strategic marketing, integrated communications and marketing function management.</div>
			<div class="display-text">Despite all my success, a series of layoffs during the recession revealed a glaring chinc in my armor. Digital had just become the new black and my resume didn't exactly scream "www". I had a fair amount of digital experience but it wasn't enough for the middle/upper management positions I sought. So I took what was offered knowing the roles wouldn't work long term &mdash; and they didn't. And after a few years of short employment stints bookended by increasing periods of unemployment, I went from "rising star" to radioactive.</div>
			<div class="display-text">Around that time I had two major life events (and a bunch of minor ones too from which I'll spare you). Without getting too personal, one involved the ending of a parent's life and the other involved the birth of my second child. Karma seemed to be telling me something. So my professional life went on the back burner and I stepped away from my career.</div>
			<div class="display-text">But behind every challenge there is an opportunity. During my time away I filled the digital gaps on my resume. With a vengeance. And kind of by accident. It's a whole other story. Suffice it to say some years ago I had a frustrating experience with a craptastic, DIY web builder. Today, I'm designing and coding my own sites from scratch.</div>
