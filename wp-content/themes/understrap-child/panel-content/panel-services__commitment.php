It's your call. I'm comfortable supporting, contributing or even managing efforts on your behalf.</p>
					<p class="commitment__body_copy"><span class=" commitment__body-copy--leader">You decide my level of involvement.</span> I am available for freelance, part-time and contract (short-term) engagements. My services are available via consultation, facilitation or execution.</p>
					<p class="commitment__body_copy"><span class=" commitment__body-copy--leader">You pay the bills.</span> If you want my opinion, you'll have it. If you want recommendations, you'll get them. If you want me to shut up and just do what I'm told, just say so.</p>

					<p class="commitment__body_copy"><span class=" commitment__body-copy--leader">I do not charge by the hour </span> (spare a few exceptions). I expect to be compensated relative to the value I bring to your effort not the time spent at your expense.</p>
					<p class="commitment__body_copy"><span class=" commitment__body-copy--leader">I never markup hard costs.</span> Everything is passed through at cost. No exceptions.</p>
					<p class="commitment__body_copy"><span class=" commitment__body-copy--leader">I don't play the smoke and mirrors game.</span> There are things marketing can do and others it can not. I'll always shoot you straight.</p>

					<p class="commitment__body_copy"><span class=" commitment__body-copy--leader">I have nothing to prove.</span> If I ever did, it was done a long time ago. My only motivation is to deliver value.</p>
					<p class="commitment__body_copy"><span class=" commitment__body-copy--leader">I know my limits.</span> I'm good at what I do, but no one is good at everything. If I'm not right for the job, I'll tell you.</p>
					<p class="commitment__body_copy"><span class=" commitment__body-copy--leader">I try to stick to plain English.</span> I do my best to keep all the technical and mystical marketing mumbo-jumbo to a minimum.</p>
